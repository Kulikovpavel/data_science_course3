#Feature Selection in tidy_set.txt 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 


These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

+ tBodyAcc-XYZ
+ tGravityAcc-XYZ
+ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyGyro-XYZ
+ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
+ tBodyAccMag
+ tGravityAccMag
+ tBodyAccJerkMag
+ tBodyGyroMag
+ tBodyGyroJerkMag
+ fBodyAcc-XYZ
+ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
+ fBodyGyro-XYZ
+ fBodyAccMag
+ fBodyAccJerkMag
+ fBodyGyroMag
+ fBodyGyroJerkMag


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

+ mean(): Mean value
+ std(): Standard deviation
+ angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

+ gravityMean
+ tBodyAccMean
+ tBodyAccJerkMean
+ tBodyGyroMean
+ tBodyGyroJerkMean
